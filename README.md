# MyWeather
This is my first android app made by Jetpack Compose.

This app allows you to monitor the weather, create notes, and plan your days based on the weather.

Master branch: stable version, sometimes not current, old version.

lab2NavSnackBar: sometimes not stable, but newest version, should be taken as an actual beta version.

veryBadBrunch: absolutly unsable version. Used to save changes that may be update to stable version in future.

lab2try: unstable version that used to try some feautures
